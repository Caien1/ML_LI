# FRCNN - A Lightweight Matrix Math & Neural Net Library in C

This header-only C library implements basic matrix operations and utilities tailored for building simple neural networks from scratch. It forms the backbone of a feedforward neural network that can be trained (e.g., to learn XOR or other logical gates) **without using any external libraries**.

## Features

 Pure C (header + implementation)  
 No dependencies except standard C libs  
 Matrix operations with memory safety (`calloc`, `assert`)  
 Activation support: `sigmoid`  
 Homogeneous coordinate (still working on it contains bugs)
 Matrix printing and debugging tools  
 Easily embeddable in other C projects
